# 📢 Announcement

Storybook monthly is where we gather to socialize, update release progress, discuss project-wide maintenance, give project updates and demos, and brainstorm about the project's future.

It's a casual public meeting, and everybody is welcome, regardless of their level of participation.

Look for a link to the [zoom](https://zoom.us/) meeting 15 minutes before the meeting starts in the Storybook Discord's [#maintenance channel](https://discord.gg/qhAxMgN). We'll share [notes and screen recording](https://github.com/storybookjs/community) afterwards.
