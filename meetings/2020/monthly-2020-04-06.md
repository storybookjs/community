# üì¢ Announcement

Storybook monthly is where we gather to socialize, update release progress, discuss project-wide maintenance, give project updates and demos, and brainstorm about the project's future.

It's a casual public meeting, and everybody is welcome, regardless of their level of participation.

Look for a link to the [zoom](https://zoom.us/) meeting 15 minutes before the meeting starts in the Storybook Discord's [#maintenance channel](https://discord.gg/qhAxMgN). We'll share [notes and screen recording](https://github.com/storybookjs/community) afterwards.

### üí° Highlights

@ndelangen @gaetanmaisse "create a scripted example creation with e2e test"

- install (done)
- bootstrap (done)
- local registry (me)
- run framework cli to create an project
- use storybook cli too bootstrap on top of new project
- create a static build of storybook of project
- host it locally in CI
- run cypress with a few tests
This would replace the need for a lot of the examples, and thus make bootstrapping a lot faster
We also want to create example repos that would allow us to link to clone-able examples so people can try it out.

Examples and documentation discussion:
- We should try to emulate nextjs example format
- Need to integrate presets somehow
- @shilman initiate next.js preset with @timneutkens
- @mrmckeb @shilman progress on typescript preset - closing in on zero-config!
- Need better prerelease community testing @shilman @domyen
