# üì¢ Announcement

Storybook monthly is where we gather to socialize, update release progress, discuss project-wide maintenance, give project updates and demos, and brainstorm about the project's future.

It's a casual public meeting, and everybody is welcome, regardless of their level of participation.

Look for a link to the [zoom](https://zoom.us/) meeting 15 minutes before the meeting starts in the Storybook Discord's [#maintenance channel](https://discord.gg/qhAxMgN). We'll share [notes and screen recording](https://github.com/storybookjs/community) afterwards.

### Documentation overhaul for 6.0

- Markdown in repo / presentation in front-page
- https://github.com/storybookjs/frontpage/pull/101
- Versioned docs

Documentation lags behind the features

- Information architecture
- Content

Multi-language? - hard to version (glamorous website had interesting versioning)

How MUI handles translations https://crowdin.com/project/material-ui-docs

Gatsby docs are basically API docs

Need to inform people that documentation is out of date

Core addons - part of the documentation experience

### React Fast Refresh

First attempt failed due to incompatible SB webpack magic that generates virtual modules in memory. Possible fixes:

- Write to a file system (hacky fix behind a feature flag as short-term 6.0 fix)
- Split all files into entry (as long-term 7.0 fix)

### Examples overhaul

Goal to strip out most of the content from the monorepo

Standardize the way template generation is done from the CLI

- Same files / same selectors

Uniform infrastructure

- E2E testing across all the frameworks
- Fixture projects for CLI
- Framework x version x addons - parallelize it across CI

Q: How about focused tests for a specific add-on, e.g. addon-docs?
A1: There‚Äôs currently e2e tests for official-storybook, can add them there?
A2: Will sleep on it for a general solution
