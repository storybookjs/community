# 📢 Announcement

Storybook monthly is where we gather to socialize, update release progress, discuss project-wide maintenance, give project updates and demos, and brainstorm about the project's future.

It's a casual public meeting, and everybody is welcome, regardless of their level of participation.

Look for a link to the [zoom](https://zoom.us/) meeting 15 minutes before the meeting starts in the Storybook Discord's [#maintenance channel](https://discord.gg/qhAxMgN). We'll share [notes and screen recording](https://github.com/storybookjs/community) afterwards.

#### React as peerDep vs dep

Update https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/12972 to match the following:

- `react` and `react-dom` as peerDeps for all `lib` packages needing them
- `react` and `react-dom` as peerDeps + optional tag for all `addon` packages needing them
- `react` and `react-dom` as regular deps for all non react apps
- Try to remove `react` and `react-dom` from root `package.json`
- A fixed version of `react` in all examples?

--> @Gaëtan

#### TS migration of @storybook/core

https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/12839
Migration is more or less done but types need to be refined, all added types are for now not publically exposed.

For 6.1 we will resolve the conflicts and fix some - already public - types.
Types improvement will be done in other PR.

--> @Gaëtan + @Yann
